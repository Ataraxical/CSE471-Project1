        <h2>Score Format</h2>
        <p>The score is formatted as an XML document with 3 types of nodes: Scores, Instruments, and Notes.
        <br><br>The score has attributes indicating the beats per minute (bpm) of the score and the number of beats per measure (time signature numerator). The denominator is assumed to be 4 (i.e. a "beat" is a quarter note).
        <br><br>
        Instruments have attributes indicating the instrument type and if effects are enabled (t = enabled, f = disabled) for that instrument (i.e. gate="t").
        
           Notes have many attributes:
           <ul>
            <li>measure: the measure the note is to be played in.</li>
            <li>beat: the beat within the measure that the note is to be played in. Can contain fractional numbers.</li>
            <li>duration: the duration (in beats) that the note is to be played for.</li>
            <li>note: the note value to indicate the frequency of the note. Uses sharps, not flats. Formatted as value + octave + sharp (i.e. E3 or E3#).</li>
            <li>velocity: indicates the intonation with which the note is to be played (l for loud, s for soft).</li>
            <li>pedal: indicates if the piano's sustain pedal was depressed for this note.</li>
           </ul> 
        
        <i>Note: Instruments are children of scores and notes are children of instruments.</i></p>
